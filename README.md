#### **Create an Environment**
```
conda create -p venv python==3.8
```

#### **Why We create new environment?**

In Visual Studio (VS) for Python, an environment is a self-contained, isolated Python runtime environment that allows you to install and manage specific versions of Python and third-party packages for a particular project.
- Creating an environment in VS Python has several benefits, including:
- Isolation: An environment provides a clean and isolated environment for your Python project, preventing conflicts with other Python projects or system-level Python installations. This ensures that your project uses only the packages and dependencies that you explicitly install, making it easier to manage and deploy.
- Reproducibility: By creating an environment with a specific set of packages and dependencies, you can ensure that your code runs consistently across different machines and environments.
- Version control: You can easily track the dependencies and packages used in your project by including the environment configuration file in your version control system.
- Flexibility: With an environment, you can easily switch between different Python versions or package configurations for different projects.

Overall, creating an environment in VS Python helps ensure that your Python project is consistent, reproducible, and easy to manage.

#### **Create requirements.txt file**
- Its purpose for installing packages and libraries required for project.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### **Create setup.py file**
In Python projects, a setup.py file is a standard file used to define the metadata for your project, as well as to specify how your project should be installed, distributed, and built.

The setup.py file is required in Python projects because:

- Metadata: It provides metadata about your project, such as the project name, version, author, description, and license. This information is used by tools like PyPI (Python Package Index) to display information about your project and by other developers who want to use or contribute to your project.

- Distribution: It defines how your project should be packaged and distributed, including which files should be included in the package and how to create distribution packages such as source distributions, wheel distributions, and binary distributions.

- Installation: It specifies the dependencies that your project requires, and how to install those dependencies, as well as any installation instructions or scripts that need to be run.

- Building: It provides instructions on how to build your project, including how to compile any C or Cython code, how to generate documentation, and how to run tests.

Overall, the setup.py file is an essential part of Python projects because it provides a standardized way to define project metadata, specify dependencies, and package and distribute your project. It is used by tools like pip and setuptools to install, build, and distribute Python packages, and it makes it easier for other developers to use and contribute to your project.
